# How to create docs

Read the Docs simplifies software documentation by automating building, versioning, and hosting of your docs for you.

## Docs tutorial

In this tutorial you will create a documentation project on Read the Docs with Sphinx and Markdown. The only things you will need to follow are a web browser, an Internet connection, and a GitHub account.

### Getting Started

First make a directory on your pc (I have created a dir named ansible-notebook) and navigate to the directory. In a second step its better to create virtual enviroment and upgrade `pip` as with below commands:

```console
python3 -m venv venv
python3 -m pip install -U pip
```

Now project is ready to proceed for next step to install our dependancies.
