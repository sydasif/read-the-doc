# [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/)

Read the Docs simplifies software documentation by automating building, versioning, and hosting of your docs for you.

## Project tutorial

In this tutorial, you will create a documentation project on **Read the Docs** with Sphinx and Markdown. The only things you will need to follow are a web browser, an Internet connection, and a GitHub account.

### Getting Started

First, make a directory on your pc (I have created a dir named read-the-doc) and navigate to the directory. In the second step it's better to create a virtual environment and upgrade `pip` as with the below commands:

```console
python3 -m pip install -U pip
```

```console
python3 -m venv venv
```

Now the project is ready to proceed to the next step to install our dependencies.
